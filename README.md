***The images of winning and losing the game are not fully installed, because I am lazy as SHIIIIIIT.

***Haven't came up with the solution of image display when the game starts or ends or a counting system, hopefully will solve this in the future when move this game into Unity.

Welcome for any suggestions and modifications.
